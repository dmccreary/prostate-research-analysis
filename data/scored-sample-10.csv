8890,32215577,Outcomes of Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: The ORIOLE Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial,JAMA Oncol. 2020 May 1;6(5):650-659. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.0147.,Phillips R,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215577,"IMPORTANCE: Complete metastatic ablation of oligometastatic prostate cancer may provide an alternative to early initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). OBJECTIVE: To determine if stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) improves oncologic outcomes in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer (ORIOLE) phase 2 randomized study accrued participants from 3 US radiation treatment facilities affiliated with a university hospital from May 2016 to March 2018 with a data cutoff date of May 20, 2019, for analysis. Of 80 men screened, 54 men with recurrent hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases detectable by conventional imaging who had not received ADT within 6 months of enrollment or 3 or more years total were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SABR or observation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was progression at 6 months by prostate-specific antigen level increase, progression detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, ADT initiation for any reason, or death. Predefined secondary outcomes were toxic effects of SABR, local control at 6 months with SABR, progression-free survival, Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)-measured quality of life, and concordance between conventional imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted positron emission tomography in the identification of metastatic disease. RESULTS: In the 54 men randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (61-70) years for patients allocated to SABR and 68 (64-76) years for those allocated to observation. Progression at 6 months occurred in 7 of 36 patients (19%) receiving SABR and 11 of 18 patients (61%) undergoing observation (P = .005). Treatment with SABR improved median progression-free survival (not reached vs 5.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.81; P = .002). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%; P = .006). No toxic effects of grade 3 or greater were observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified significant increased clonotypic expansion following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only (0.082085 vs 0.026051; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with SABR for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography. SABR induced a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with integrated imaging and biological correlates.

Epub 2020 Feb 21.,Costello AJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32086498,"The practice of radical prostatectomy for treating prostate cancer has evolved remarkably since its general introduction around 1900. Initially described using a perineal approach, the procedure was later popularized using a retropubic one, after it was first described as such in 1948. The open surgical method has now largely been abandoned in favour of the minimally invasive robot-assisted method, which was first described in 2000. Until 1980, the procedure was hazardous, often accompanied by massive blood loss and poor outcomes. For patients in whom surgery is indicated, prostatectomy is increasingly being used as the first step in a multitherapeutic approach in advanced local, and even early metastatic, disease. However, contemporary molecular insights have enabled many men to safely avoid surgical intervention when the disease is phenotypically indolent and use of active surveillance programmes continues to expand worldwide. In 2020, surgery is not recommended in those men with low-grade, low-volume Gleason 6 prostate cancer; previously these men - a large cohort of ~40% of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer - were offered surgery in large numbers, with little clinical benefit and considerable adverse effects. Radical prostatectomy is appropriate for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease (Gleason score 7-9 or Grade Groups 2-5) in whom radical prostatectomy prevents further metastatic seeding of potentially lethal clones of prostate cancer cells. Small series have suggested that it might be appropriate to offer radical prostatectomy to men presenting with small metastatic burden (nodal and or bone) as part of a multimodal therapeutic approach. Furthermore, surgical treatment of prostate cancer has been reported in cohorts of octogenarian men in good health with minimal comorbidities, when 20 years ago such men were rarely treated surgically even when diagnosed with localized high-risk disease. As medical therapies for prostate cancer continue to increase, the use of surgery might seem to be less relevant; however, the changing demographics of prostate cancer means that radical prostatectomy remains an important and useful option in many men, with a changing indication.",28

Biopsies performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) targeting may reduce the misclassification of prostate cancer in men with MRI-visible lesions. METHODS: Men with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent both MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy. The primary outcome was cancer detection according to grade group (i.e., a clustering of Gleason grades). Grade group 1 refers to clinically insignificant disease; grade group 2 or higher, cancer with favorable intermediate risk or worse; and grade group 3 or higher, cancer with unfavorable intermediate risk or worse. Among the men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, upgrading and downgrading of grade group from biopsy to whole-mount histopathological analysis of surgical specimens were recorded. Secondary outcomes were the detection of cancers of grade group 2 or higher and grade group 3 or higher, cancer detection stratified by previous biopsy status, and grade reclassification between biopsy and radical prostatectomy. RESULTS: A total of 2103 men underwent both biopsy methods; cancer was diagnosed in 1312 (62.4%) by a combination of the two methods (combined biopsy), and 404 (19.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Cancer detection rates on MRI-targeted biopsy were significantly lower than on systematic biopsy for grade group 1 cancers and significantly higher for grade groups 3 through 5 (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Combined biopsy led to cancer diagnoses in 208 more men (9.9%) than with either method alone and to upgrading to a higher grade group in 458 men (21.8%). However, if only MRI-target biopsies had been performed, 8.8% of clinically significant cancers (grade group ≥3) would have been misclassified. Among the 404 men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, combined biopsy was associated with the fewest upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis of surgical specimens (3.5%), as compared with MRI-targeted biopsy (8.7%) and systematic biopsy (16.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with MRI-visible lesions, combined biopsy led to more detection of all prostate cancers. However, MRI-targeted biopsy alone underestimated the histologic grade of some tumors. After radical prostatectomy, upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis were substantially lower after combined biopsy.

HDR brachytherapy has evolved over the decades to be administered in 1-2 fractions. As either monotherapy or in combination with external beam, it offers many advantages over other treatment alternatives. Precise control over dose delivery allows focal dose escalation while sculpting dose around critical organs to maintain excellent tolerance. The high dose per fraction exploits the low α/β ratio of prostate cancer and triggers transcriptional changes in the tumor genome enhancing radiation sensitivity. We review the development, patient selection and results, and describe in detail the techniques for HDR brachytherapy.",24

Epub 2020 May 11.,Lenfant L,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409202,"Often contraindicated because of the theoretical risk of progression based on the dogma of hormone dependent prostate cancer (CaP), testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is increasingly discussed and proposed for hypogonadal patients with localized CaP. To perform a systematic literature review to determine the relationship between TRT and the risk of CaP with a focus on the impact of TRT in the setting of previous or active localized CaP. As of October 15, 2019, systematic review was performed via Medline Embase and Cochrane databases in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All full text articles in English published from January 1994 to February 2018 were included. Articles were considered if they reported about the relationship between total testosterone or bioavailable testosterone and CaP. Emphasis was given to prospective studies, series with observational data and randomized controlled trials. Articles about the safety of the testosterone therapy were categorized by type of CaP management (active surveillance or curative treatment by radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy or brachytherapy). Until more definitive data becomes available, clinicians wishing to treat their hypogonadal patients with localized CaP with TRT should inform them of the lack of evidence regarding the safety of long-term treatment for the risk of CaP progression. However, in patients without known CaP, the evidence seems sufficient to think that androgen therapy does not increase the risk of subsequent discovery of CaP.",54

OBJECTIVE: To compare functional outcomes associated with prostate cancer treatments over 5 years after treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, population-based cohort study of 1386 men with favorable-risk (clinical stage cT1 to cT2bN0M0, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≤20 ng/mL, and Grade Group 1-2) prostate cancer and 619 men with unfavorable-risk (clinical stage cT2cN0M0, PSA of 20-50 ng/mL, or Grade Group 3-5) prostate cancer diagnosed in 2011 through 2012, accrued from 5 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program sites and a US prostate cancer registry, with surveys through September 2017. EXPOSURES: Treatment with active surveillance (n = 363), nerve-sparing prostatectomy (n = 675), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; n = 261), or low-dose-rate brachytherapy (n = 87) for men with favorable-risk disease and treatment with prostatectomy (n = 402) or EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy (n = 217) for men with unfavorable-risk disease. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient-reported function, based on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (range, 0-100), 5 years after treatment. Regression models were adjusted for baseline function and patient and tumor characteristics. Minimum clinically important difference was 10 to 12 for sexual function, 6 to 9 for urinary incontinence, 5 to 7 for urinary irritative symptoms, and 4 to 6 for bowel and hormonal function. RESULTS: A total of 2005 men met inclusion criteria and completed the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline survey (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [59-70] years; 1529 of 1993 participants [77%] were non-Hispanic white). For men with favorable-risk prostate cancer, nerve-sparing prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, -10.9 [95% CI, -14.2 to -7.6]) and sexual function at 3 years (adjusted mean difference, -15.2 [95% CI, -18.8 to -11.5]) compared with active surveillance. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was associated with worse urinary irritative (adjusted mean difference, -7.0 [95% CI, -10.1 to -3.9]), sexual (adjusted mean difference, -10.1 [95% CI, -14.6 to -5.7]), and bowel (adjusted mean difference, -5.0 [95% CI, -7.6 to -2.4]) function at 1 year compared with active surveillance. EBRT was associated with urinary, sexual, and bowel function changes not clinically different from active surveillance at any time point through 5 years. For men with unfavorable-risk disease, EBRT with ADT was associated with lower hormonal function at 6 months (adjusted mean difference, -5.3 [95% CI, -8.2 to -2.4]) and bowel function at 1 year (adjusted mean difference, -4.1 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.9]), but better sexual function at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, 12.5 [95% CI, 6.2-18.7]) and incontinence at each time point through 5 years (adjusted mean difference, 23.2 [95% CI, 17.7-28.7]), than prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, most functional differences associated with contemporary management options attenuated by 5 years. However, men undergoing prostatectomy reported clinically meaningful worse incontinence through 5 years compared with all other options, and men undergoing prostatectomy for unfavorable-risk disease reported worse sexual function at 5 years compared with men who underwent EBRT with ADT.",62

The aim of our study was to determine the effect of pre-operative MUL on 12 month continence outcomes in men having robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). METHODS: We use the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative (SA-PCCOC) database, to identify 602 patients who had undergone RALP by a high volume surgeon. Only patients who received an assessment and education by a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist, had completed EPIC questionnaires before treatment and did not have radiotherapy treatment within 12 months of surgery were included. MUL measurements were taken from pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The short-form version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) was used to measure continence outcomes. Continence was defined as 100/100 in the EPIC-26 Urinary Continence domain score. RESULTS: The observed median MUL in this study was 14.6 mm. There was no association between MUL and baseline continence. MUL was associated with continence at 12 months post RALP (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.21, p = 0.0098). In men who were continent before surgery, MUL was associated with return to continence at 12 months after RALP (OR 1.15, 1.05-1.28, p = 0.006). MUL was also associated with change in continence after surgery (β = 1.22, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: MUL had no effect on baseline continence but had a positive and significant association with continence outcomes over 12 months post RALP.",36
