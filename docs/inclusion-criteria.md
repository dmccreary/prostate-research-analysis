## Study Acceptance Criteria:

1. Patients must be stratified into recognizable Pre-Treatment Risk Groups: Low, Intermediate, and High Risk by
either Dâ€™Amico, Zelefsky or NCCN stratification. The risk group must be maintained after treatment.
2. Evaluate the following endpoints if reported: BRFS (biochemical relapse free survival) standard endpoint ASTRO, Phoenix, and PSA &lt; 0.2 (surgery), OS (overall survival), MFS (metastasis free survival), and CSS (cause specific
survival).
3. No exclusions, i.e. No Pathologic staging. In other words, after surgery the surgeon could not eliminate or exclude a patient from future analysis because of an unfavorable feature, such as positive margin or positive
lymph nodes.
4. External doses must be modern doses. Minimum 72 Gy standard fractionated IMRT/conformal.
5. All treatment modalities must be considered; Seeds (Brachy), Surgery (both Standard and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy), EBRT (including standard fractionation, hypofractionation, and ultra hypofractionation/SBRT),
HIFU (High Intensity Frequency Ultrasound), CRYO (Cryotherapy), Protons and/or HDR (see list above.)
6. Only articles from peer reviewed journals are included. Peer reviewed journals are those in which every article is first reviewed by an expert panel before publication.
Presentations and/or posters do not meet criteria.
7. An adequate number of patients must be included. Low-Risk accepted minimum number 100 patients.
Intermediate-Risk accepted minimum number 100 patients. High-Risk accepted minimum number 50 patients.
8. Minimum median follow up: 5 yr. This is to insure that patients were followed long enough to adequately
evaluate the results long-term.
