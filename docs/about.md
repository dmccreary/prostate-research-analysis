# About this Site

One of the biggest problems with prostate cancer treatments is the many variations in types of treatments.  And the state-of-the art treatments are constantly evolving.  Every year there are almost 9,000 new papers published on prostrate cancer treatments.  But which ones are the most relevant to helping you make the right decision about what treatments are right for you?

Researchers at the non-for profit organization [Prostate Cancer Free](https://www.prostatecancerfree.org/) have struggled with this question for many years.  In the past, experts spent hundreds of hours each year reading all the articles on PubMed to find the 30 or so most significant papers from the 9,000 published each year.  Over time these prostrate researchers developed a set of complex [rules](./summary-criteria.md) for determining the most relevant papers that they should use and also recommend to their patients.

This repository stores information about the processes of using AI to create a Python classifier for prostate cancer treatment papers and articles.  The site was created by [Dan McCreary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/) working with [Dr. R. Alex Hsi, M.D.](https://www.prostatecancerfree.org/project/pcrsg-bio-r-alex-hsi-md/).

The workflow for creating the classifier is documented on the [Workflow](./workflow/index.md) section of this site.  You can see the raw data files in the [Data](https://github.com/dmccreary/prostate-research-analysis/tree/main/data) folder of our GitHub repository.

Some sample [Data Viewers](./data-viewers/index.md) can also be used to view the data.
