# Creating a Python Program to Score Each Paper

!!! prompt
    Please create Prostate Cancer Treatment Only Comparative Effectiveness Study Scoring program in Python.

    I would like you to create a Python program that does classification of each row of data in the output100.csv file.  The first row is only metadata.  The other 99 lines represent papers and abstracts from Medline.  The output100.csv file contains descriptions and abstracts of prostrate cancer research.  I would like you to use the summary-criteria.md which contains rule to create a score for each line in the output100.csv file.  The score should range on a scale of 0 to 100.  A score of 0 means that none of the criteria match.  A score of 100 implies that all of the summary-criteria are matching.

    Please have the Python program add a new column to the CSV with the score in it.  Label the column "score".
