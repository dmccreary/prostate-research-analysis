Patients must be stratified into recognizable Pre-Treatment Risk Groups: Low, Intermediate, and High Risk by either D\u2019Amico, Zelefsky or NCCN stratification. The risk group must be maintained after treatment. 2. Evaluate the following endpoints if reported: BRFS (biochemical relapse free survival) standard endpoint ASTRO, Phoenix, and PSA &lt; 0.2 (surgery), OS (overall survival), MFS (metastasis free survival), and CSS (cause specific survival). 3. No exclusions, i.e. No Pathologic staging. In other words, after surgery the surgeon could not eliminate or exclude a patient from future analysis because of an unfavorable feature, such as positive margin or positive lymph nodes. 4. External doses must be modern doses. Minimum 72 Gy standard fractionated IMRT/conformal. 5. All treatment modalities must be considered; Seeds (Brachy), Surgery (both Standard and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy), EBRT (including standard fractionation, hypofractionation, and ultra hypofractionation/SBRT), HIFU (High Intensity Frequency Ultrasound), CRYO (Cryotherapy), Protons and/or HDR (see list above.) 6. Only articles from peer reviewed journals are included. Peer reviewed journals are those in which every article is first reviewed by an expert panel before publication. \u2022 Presentations and/or posters do not meet criteria. 7. An adequate number of patients must be included. Low-Risk accepted minimum number 100 patients. Intermediate-Risk accepted minimum number 100 patients. High-Risk accepted minimum number 50 patients. 8. Minimum median follow up: 5 yr. This is to insure that patients were followed long enough to adequately evaluate the results long-term.</p>"},{"location":"license/","title":"Creative Commons License","text":"<p>All content in this repository is governed by the following license agreement:</p>"},{"location":"license/#license-type","title":"License Type","text":"<p>Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DEED)</p>"},{"location":"license/#link-to-license-agreement","title":"Link to License Agreement","text":"<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en</p>"},{"location":"license/#your-rights","title":"Your Rights","text":"<p>You are free to:</p> <ul> <li>Share \u2014 copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format</li> <li>Adapt \u2014 remix, transform, and build upon the material</li> </ul> <p>The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.</p>"},{"location":"license/#restrictions","title":"Restrictions","text":"<ul> <li>Attribution \u2014 You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
