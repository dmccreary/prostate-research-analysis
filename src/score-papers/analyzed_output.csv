OBJECTIVE: To determine if stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) improves oncologic outcomes in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer (ORIOLE) phase 2 randomized study accrued participants from 3 US radiation treatment facilities affiliated with a university hospital from May 2016 to March 2018 with a data cutoff date of May 20, 2019, for analysis. Of 80 men screened, 54 men with recurrent hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases detectable by conventional imaging who had not received ADT within 6 months of enrollment or 3 or more years total were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SABR or observation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was progression at 6 months by prostate-specific antigen level increase, progression detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, ADT initiation for any reason, or death. Predefined secondary outcomes were toxic effects of SABR, local control at 6 months with SABR, progression-free survival, Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)-measured quality of life, and concordance between conventional imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted positron emission tomography in the identification of metastatic disease. RESULTS: In the 54 men randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (61-70) years for patients allocated to SABR and 68 (64-76) years for those allocated to observation. Progression at 6 months occurred in 7 of 36 patients (19%) receiving SABR and 11 of 18 patients (61%) undergoing observation (P = .005). Treatment with SABR improved median progression-free survival (not reached vs 5.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.81; P = .002). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%; P = .006). No toxic effects of grade 3 or greater were observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified significant increased clonotypic expansion following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only (0.082085 vs 0.026051; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with SABR for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography. SABR induced a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR. These results underline the importance of prospective randomized investigation of the oligometastatic state with integrated imaging and biological correlates.

Epub 2020 Feb 21.,Costello AJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32086498,"The practice of radical prostatectomy for treating prostate cancer has evolved remarkably since its general introduction around 1900. Initially described using a perineal approach, the procedure was later popularized using a retropubic one, after it was first described as such in 1948. The open surgical method has now largely been abandoned in favour of the minimally invasive robot-assisted method, which was first described in 2000. Until 1980, the procedure was hazardous, often accompanied by massive blood loss and poor outcomes. For patients in whom surgery is indicated, prostatectomy is increasingly being used as the first step in a multitherapeutic approach in advanced local, and even early metastatic, disease. However, contemporary molecular insights have enabled many men to safely avoid surgical intervention when the disease is phenotypically indolent and use of active surveillance programmes continues to expand worldwide. In 2020, surgery is not recommended in those men with low-grade, low-volume Gleason 6 prostate cancer; previously these men - a large cohort of ~40% of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer - were offered surgery in large numbers, with little clinical benefit and considerable adverse effects. Radical prostatectomy is appropriate for men with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease (Gleason score 7-9 or Grade Groups 2-5) in whom radical prostatectomy prevents further metastatic seeding of potentially lethal clones of prostate cancer cells. Small series have suggested that it might be appropriate to offer radical prostatectomy to men presenting with small metastatic burden (nodal and or bone) as part of a multimodal therapeutic approach. Furthermore, surgical treatment of prostate cancer has been reported in cohorts of octogenarian men in good health with minimal comorbidities, when 20 years ago such men were rarely treated surgically even when diagnosed with localized high-risk disease. As medical therapies for prostate cancer continue to increase, the use of surgery might seem to be less relevant; however, the changing demographics of prostate cancer means that radical prostatectomy remains an important and useful option in many men, with a changing indication.",FALSE,N/A,UNKNOWN,60

Biopsies performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) targeting may reduce the misclassification of prostate cancer in men with MRI-visible lesions. METHODS: Men with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent both MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy. The primary outcome was cancer detection according to grade group (i.e., a clustering of Gleason grades). Grade group 1 refers to clinically insignificant disease; grade group 2 or higher, cancer with favorable intermediate risk or worse; and grade group 3 or higher, cancer with unfavorable intermediate risk or worse. Among the men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, upgrading and downgrading of grade group from biopsy to whole-mount histopathological analysis of surgical specimens were recorded. Secondary outcomes were the detection of cancers of grade group 2 or higher and grade group 3 or higher, cancer detection stratified by previous biopsy status, and grade reclassification between biopsy and radical prostatectomy. RESULTS: A total of 2103 men underwent both biopsy methods; cancer was diagnosed in 1312 (62.4%) by a combination of the two methods (combined biopsy), and 404 (19.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Cancer detection rates on MRI-targeted biopsy were significantly lower than on systematic biopsy for grade group 1 cancers and significantly higher for grade groups 3 through 5 (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Combined biopsy led to cancer diagnoses in 208 more men (9.9%) than with either method alone and to upgrading to a higher grade group in 458 men (21.8%). However, if only MRI-target biopsies had been performed, 8.8% of clinically significant cancers (grade group ≥3) would have been misclassified. Among the 404 men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, combined biopsy was associated with the fewest upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis of surgical specimens (3.5%), as compared with MRI-targeted biopsy (8.7%) and systematic biopsy (16.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with MRI-visible lesions, combined biopsy led to more detection of all prostate cancers. However, MRI-targeted biopsy alone underestimated the histologic grade of some tumors. After radical prostatectomy, upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis were substantially lower after combined biopsy.

EXPOSURES: Treatment with active surveillance (n = 363), nerve-sparing prostatectomy (n = 675), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT; n = 261), or low-dose-rate brachytherapy (n = 87) for men with favorable-risk disease and treatment with prostatectomy (n = 402) or EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy (n = 217) for men with unfavorable-risk disease. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient-reported function, based on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (range, 0-100), 5 years after treatment. Regression models were adjusted for baseline function and patient and tumor characteristics. Minimum clinically important difference was 10 to 12 for sexual function, 6 to 9 for urinary incontinence, 5 to 7 for urinary irritative symptoms, and 4 to 6 for bowel and hormonal function. RESULTS: A total of 2005 men met inclusion criteria and completed the baseline and at least 1 postbaseline survey (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [59-70] years; 1529 of 1993 participants [77%] were non-Hispanic white). For men with favorable-risk prostate cancer, nerve-sparing prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, -10.9 [95% CI, -14.2 to -7.6]) and sexual function at 3 years (adjusted mean difference, -15.2 [95% CI, -18.8 to -11.5]) compared with active surveillance. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was associated with worse urinary irritative (adjusted mean difference, -7.0 [95% CI, -10.1 to -3.9]), sexual (adjusted mean difference, -10.1 [95% CI, -14.6 to -5.7]), and bowel (adjusted mean difference, -5.0 [95% CI, -7.6 to -2.4]) function at 1 year compared with active surveillance. EBRT was associated with urinary, sexual, and bowel function changes not clinically different from active surveillance at any time point through 5 years. For men with unfavorable-risk disease, EBRT with ADT was associated with lower hormonal function at 6 months (adjusted mean difference, -5.3 [95% CI, -8.2 to -2.4]) and bowel function at 1 year (adjusted mean difference, -4.1 [95% CI, -6.3 to -1.9]), but better sexual function at 5 years (adjusted mean difference, 12.5 [95% CI, 6.2-18.7]) and incontinence at each time point through 5 years (adjusted mean difference, 23.2 [95% CI, 17.7-28.7]), than prostatectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, most functional differences associated with contemporary management options attenuated by 5 years.

METHODS: We use the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative (SA-PCCOC) database, to identify 602 patients who had undergone RALP by a high volume surgeon. Only patients who received an assessment and education by a specialist pelvic floor physiotherapist, had completed EPIC questionnaires before treatment and did not have radiotherapy treatment within 12 months of surgery were included.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with organ-confined, node-negative prostate cancer who had biochemical failure (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] less than 2.0) after prostatectomy were eligible for this phase 1 dose-escalation trial. Doses delivered were 35 Gy, 40 Gy, and 45 Gy in 5 fractions, given every other day. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal or genitourinary (GU) toxicity within 90 days of treatment. Maximum tolerated dose was the highest dose to be tested where fewer than 2 of the patients experienced DLT. Patients completed quality-of-life questionnaires at regular time intervals.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring and the selected use of SRT has some advantages when compared with adjuvant radiotherapy. The most important one is avoidance of a potential overtreatment of patients who would never have disease progression, even in the presence of high-risk pathological features. The identification of a specific PSA cut-off seems to be incorrect. In patients with more adverse pathological features, early SRT administered at the very first sign of a PSA rise granted better disease control. Dose-intensified SRT is feasible and well tolerated with no significant difference in grade 2 or more acute and late toxicity. At least 66 Gy must be given in the salvage setting. ADT has a radio-sensitising effect on the radiotherapy by inhibiting the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The use of ADT in the salvage setting results in a better oncological outcome. Hormonal therapy is associated with a decrease in quality of life and side-effects depending on the duration of hormone therapy. The oncological benefit of hormone therapy duration depends on their clinical and pathological characteristics. 68-Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography-computed tomography is the gold standard in staging prostate cancer patients with biochemical persistence or recurrence after radical prostatectomy.

We sought to test the impact of timing between RP and RT on adverse events rate. METHODS: Using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9601 trial cohort, we performed post hoc analysis of 760 men with biochemical recurrence after RP, who received subsequent RT. Bowel adverse events (rectal urgency, diarrhea, and hematochezia); bladder adverse events (urinary frequency, dysuria, hematuria, and incontinence); and new onset of erectile dysfunction were documented as acute (<90 days after starting RT) or chronic, at each visit, per trial protocol. Regression analysis tested the impact of time between RP and RT on the aforementioned adverse events, after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The rate of acute bladder, acute bowel, late bladder, late bowel, and late impotence adverse events was, respectively, 49.3%, 60.9%, 61.2%, 48.8%, and 13.6% in patients with a time period between RP and RT ≤ 2.1 years (the median) vs. 47.5%, 63%, 59.1%, 47%, and 14.5% in patients with >2.1 years (all P > 0.5). At multivariable analysis, time from RP to RT was not an independent predictor of acute bladder (odds ratio [OR]: 1.002), acute bowel (OR: 1.024), chronic bladder (OR: 0.976), chronic bowel (OR: 1.023), and late impotence (OR: 1.031) adverse events (all P > 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: There was no impact of timing between RP and RT on urinary, bowel, and erectile adverse events related to RT. Thus, our RTOG 9601 post hoc analysis challenges the current belief that early postsurgical RT compromises functional outcomes more than late RT and support additional research to evaluate the perceived benefit in terms of adverse effects by prolonging the time between RP and RT.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,73

Owing to this heterogeneity and variable prognoses, it is challenging to provide uniform treatment recommendations for men in this group. OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature regarding the best available evidence for stratification and treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched Medline and EMBASE, through September 2019 without year or language restriction, supplemented with hand search. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Different treatment options with good long-term oncological outcomes are available for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. Best available evidence with long follow-up exists for radical prostatectomy and dose-escalated radiotherapy with short-term androgen deprivation. In favorable intermediate-risk patients, active surveillance and brachy-monotherapy also represent two valid treatment options. In carefully selected men, partial gland ablation represents a reasonable option. Patient preferences and comorbidities should also be considered. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment options for intermediate-risk patients range from active surveillance to partial gland ablation, radical prostatectomy, and various radiotherapy methods. The best stratification and the optimal treatment remain controversial. Classification systems, such as the National Cancer Comprehensive Network guidelines, stratify this large cohort into subgroups with favorable or unfavorable disease, which may simplify treatment recommendations but still leave substantial variability within strata. Advanced imaging may further improve current stratification systems of intermediate-risk patients.

Multivariate and decision curve analyses revealed that inclusion of PHI to a base multivariate model including total PSA, percentage free PSA, PSA density, percentage of positive biopsy core, biopsy Gleason sum, and clinical stage factors significantly increased its predictive accuracy; %p2PSA showed a similar result. However, PHI was a more valuable predictor of pathological outcomes of RP. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed PHI and %p2PSA as preoperative biomarkers of pathological outcomes in Korean males who underwent RP for prostate cancer.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,78

METHODS: Within the National Inpatient Sample database, we identified 91,618 RP patients treated between 2008 and 2015. The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining indicator was applied, and we examined the rates of frailty over time, as well as its effect on overall complications, major complications, nonhome-based discharge, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges (THCs). Time trends and multivariable logistic, Poisson and linear regression models were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 12,185 (13.3%) patients were frail. Rates of frail patients increased over time (from 10.3 to 18.2%; p < 0.001). Frail patients had higher rates of overall complications (16.6 vs. 8.6%), major complications (4.9 vs. 2.6%), nonhome-based discharge (5.9 vs. 5%), longer LOS (2 vs. 1), and higher THCs ($37,186 vs. $35,241) (all p < 0.001). Moreover, frailty was an independent predictor of overall complications (OR: 1.95), major complications (OR: 1.76), nonhome-based discharge (OR: 1.20), longer LOS (RR: 1.19), and higher THCs (RR: $3160) (all p < 0.001). Of frail patients, 10,418 (85.5%) neither exhibited body mass index ≥ 30 nor Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 2.

Epub 2019 Nov 20.,Pilskog S,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31759076,"PURPOSE: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) of locally advanced prostate cancer can spare the bowel considerably compared with modern photon therapy, but simultaneous treatment of the prostate (p), seminal vesicles (sv), and lymph nodes is challenging owing to day-to-day organ motion and range uncertainties. Our purpose was, therefore, to generate a plan library for use in adaptive IMPT to mitigate these uncertainties. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively included 27 patients with a series of computed tomography scans throughout their treatment representing day-to-day variation. In 18 of the patients, target motion was analyzed using rigid shifts of prostate gold markers relative to bony anatomy. A plan library with different p and sv planning target volume (p/sv-PTV) positions was defined from the distribution and direction of these shifts. Delivery of IMPT using plan selection from the library was simulated for image guidance on bony anatomy, in the remaining patients and compared with nonadaptive IMPT. RESULTS: The plan library consisted of 3 small margin p/sv-PTVs: (1) p/sv-PTV shifted 1.5 systematic error (Σ) of the population mean in the anterior and cranial directions, (2) p/sv-PTV shifted 1.5Σ in the posterior and caudal directions, and (3) p/sv-PTV in the planning position. The conventional p/sv-PTV was also available for backup. Plan selection compared with nonadaptive IMPT resulted in a reduction of the rectum volume receiving 60 Gy relative biological effect (RBE) (V60<sub>GyRBE</sub>) from on average 12 mL to 9 mL. For the bladder the average V45<sub>GyRBE</sub> was reduced from 36% to 30%. Large and small bowel doses were also reduced, whereas target coverage was comparable or improved compared with nonadaptive IMPT. CONCLUSIONS: Plan selection based on a population model of rigid target motion was feasible for all patients. Compared with conventional IMPT, plan selection resulted in significant dosimetric sparing of rectum and bladder without compromising target coverage.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,50

The rates of this type of cancer have been increasing in developing nations. The risk factors for prostate cancer include age, family history, and obesity. It is believed that the rate of prostate cancer is correlated with the Western diet. Various advances in methods of radiotherapy have contributed to lowering morbidity. Therapy for hormone- refractory prostate cancer is making progress, for almost all men with metastases will proceed to hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

The serious outcome of incontinence and erectile dysfunction result from the cancer treatment of surgery and radiation, particularly for prostate- specific antigen detected cancers that will not cause morbidity or mortality. Families of patients, as well as patients, are profoundly affected following the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Poor communication between spouses during prostate cancer increases the risk for poor adjustment to prostate cancer. The use of serum prostate-specific antigen to screen for prostate cancer has led to a greater detection, in its early stage, of this cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in American men, accounting for more than 29% of all diagnosed cancers and about 13% of all cancer deaths. A shortened course of hormonal therapy with docetaxel following radical prostatectomy (or radiation therapy) for high-risk prostate cancer has been shown to be both safe and feasible. Patients treated with docetaxel-estramustine had a prostate-specific antigen response decline of at least 50%.

The role of cytoreductive radical prostatectomy has been evaluated in few retrospective clinical studies but data of prospective randomized clinical phase-III trials are lacking. It is the purpose of this review to reflect the current knowledge on indication, functional and oncological outcomes of cytoreductive radical prostatectomy to objectively highlight what can be expected from this approach. RECENT FINDINGS: Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy (cRP) is associated with a long overall survival of more than 7 years and it is associated with a clinical progression-free survival of more than 6 years. When compared with nonsurgical approaches it becomes evident that about one-third of the patients will develop symptomatic local progression within 3 years whereas none of the surgically treated patients will experience such symptoms. cRP is associated with a low rate of significant complications and good functional outcome in well selected patients which do not differ from the results of a radical prostatectomy in treatment-naïve patients. SUMMARY: Patients with low-volume/low-risk metastatic prostate cancer (mPCA), good response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and a good Eastern Cooperative Onology Group performance status appear to be the best candidates for surgery. cRP might be an individualized treatment option in the multimodality management of mPCA.

Despite efforts to preserve the neurovascular bundles with nerve sparing (NS) surgery, erectile dysfunction (ED) remains common after RP and this may significantly affect patients' quality of life (QoL). The aim of this paper is to evaluate the outcome of simultaneous placement of penile prosthesis and RP. The ideal candidates for simultaneous penile prosthesis implantation are those who report pre-existent refractory ED and patients in whom there is a high risk of extracapsular disease, such as any cT2c or cT3, and undergo non-nerve sparing RP. If the patient chooses to undergo PPI to treat his refractory ED it is clear that this procedure will be associated with higher patients' satisfaction rates, if carried out simultaneously with RP rather than at a later stage. A simultaneous procedure would avoid two admissions, reduce hospitalization time and guarantee a faster recovery of sexual function, preventing the otherwise unavoidable loss of penile length. Since the urologist does not need to preserve the neurovascular bundles, as the penile implant will take care of postoperative rigidity, RP can be performed more radically from an oncological point of view, thus reducing the risk of recurrence and metastasis, especially in patients with high risk of locally advanced disease. In conclusion, simultaneous PPI with RP provides early sexual rehabilitation, improving patients' quality of life, without compromising surgical outcomes. However, larger series will be necessary, to better identify the patients who are more likely to benefit from nerve sparing surgery and postoperative penile rehabilitation from those who would are more likely to develop refractory ED post RP and would therefore benefit from simultaneous implantation of a penile prosthesis.",FALSE,N/A,UNKNOWN,65

The fact that potential patient out-of-pocket costs might influence decision making has rarely been acknowledged and, overall, the risk of financial toxicity for men with localized prostate cancer remains poorly studied. This shortfall requires a work-up in the context of prostate cancer and a multidimensional framework for considering a patient's risk of financial toxicity. The major elements of this framework are direct and indirect costs, patient-specific values, expectations of possible financial burdens, and individual economic circumstances. Current data indicate that total cost patterns probably differ by treatment modality: surgery might have an increased short-term effect, whereas radiotherapy might have an increased long-term risk of financial toxicity. Specific thresholds of patient income levels or out-of-pocket costs that predict risk of financial toxicity are difficult to identify.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CTV (clinical target volume)-to-PTV margin ranging from 15 mm in LR (left-right) and SI (superior-inferior) and 5-10 mm in AP (anterior-posterior) direction was applied to all patients. The dosimetric influence of this margin was retrospectively calculated by analysing systematic and random components of inter and intra errors of 31 consecutive intermediate- and high-risk localized PCa patients using daily cone beam computed tomography and kV/kV (kilo-Voltage) imaging. For each patient inter variation was assessed by observing the first 4 treatment days, which led to an offline ART-based treatment plan in case of larger variations. RESULTS: Systematic inter uncertainties were larger (1.12 in LR, 2.28 in SI and 1.48 mm in AP) than intra systematic errors (0.44 in LR, 0.69 in SI and 0.80 mm in AP).

Radiotherapy is one of the most widely used treatments for prostate cancer, along with surgery, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. However, inherent radioresistance of tumor cells can reduce local control and ultimately lead to poor patient outcomes, such as recurrence, metastasis and death. The underlying mechanisms of radioresistance have not been fully elucidated, but it has been suggested that miRNAs play a critical role. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in every signaling pathway of the cell, with one miRNA often having multiple targets. By fine-tuning gene expression, miRNAs are important players in modulating DNA damage response, cell death, tumor aggression and the tumor microenvironment, and can ultimately affect a tumor's response to radiotherapy. Furthermore, much interest has focused on miRNAs found in biofluids and their potential utility in various clinical applications. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on miRNA deregulation after irradiation and the associated functional outcomes, with a focus on prostate cancer. In addition, we discuss the utility of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose, predict response to treatment, and prognosticate patient outcomes.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,55

MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, 267 consecutive men with 3-T MRI before radical prostatectomy (RP) between 2012 and 2018 were evaluated by two blinded radiologists who assigned PI-RADS v2.1 scores. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. A third blinded radiologist measured observation size and ADC (ADC.mean, ADC.min [lowest ADC within an observation], ADC.ratio [ADC.mean/ADC.peripheral zone {PZ}]). Size and ADC were compared to pathological stage and Gleason score (GS) using t tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Consensus review identified 267 true positive category 4 and 5 observations representing 83.1% (222/267) PZ and 16.9% (45/267) transition zone (TZ) tumors. Inter-observer agreement for PI-RADS v2.1 scoring was moderate (K = 0.45). Size was associated with extra-prostatic extension (EPE) (19 ± 8 versus 14 ± 6 mm, p < 0.001) and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) (24 ± 9 versus 16 ± 7 mm, p < 0.001). Size ≥ 15 mm optimized the accuracy for EPE with area under the ROC curve (AUC) and sensitivity/specificity of 0.68 (CI 0.62-0.75) and 63.2%/65.6%. Size ≥ 19 mm optimized the accuracy for SVI with AUC/sensitivity/specificity of 0.75 (CI 0.66-0.83)/69.4%/70.6%. ADC metrics were not associated with pathological stage. Larger observation size (p = 0.032), lower ADC.min (p = 0.010), and lower ADC.ratio (p = 0.010) were associated with higher GS. Size correlated better to higher Gleason scores (p = 0.002) compared to ADC metrics (p = 0.09-0.11). CONCLUSION: Among PI-RADS v2.1 category 4 and 5 observations, size was associated with higher pathological stage whereas ADC metrics were not. Size, ADC.minimum, and ADC.ratio differed in tumors stratified by Gleason score. KEY POINTS: • Among PI-RADS category 4 and 5 observations, size but not ADC can differentiate between tumors by pathological stage. • An observation size threshold of 15 mm and 19 mm optimized the accuracy for diagnosis of extra-prostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion. • Among PI-RADS category 4 and 5 observations, size, ADC.minimum, and ADC.ratio differed comparing tumors by Gleason score.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,60

However, no large reports have published cancer and quality outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To report perioperative, functional and oncologic outcomes of sRARP in patients with localised PCa recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively evaluated 106 patients with local recurrence eligible for sRARP. SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Surgery was performed using the DaVinci Si system similar to the standard approach but with adaptation to the primary treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Peri-operative outcomes included 90-day complication rate. Functional outcomes included rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Oncological outcomes included tumour staging, margin rate and recurrence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Primary treatment was High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in 59 (56%) patients, 27 (25%) radiotherapy, 10 (9%) seed brachytherapy, 8 (8%) solitary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), one (1%) cryotherapy and one (1%) electroporation / Nanoknife. Median follow-up was 2.1 years. 90-day complication rate was 8%. At two years or more, 50% were fully continent and 33% were socially continent. Continence rates tended to be better after focal compared to whole-gland treatments. Erectile dysfunction was present in 95%. Positive surgical margin rate was 39%. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 13% and local or metastatic recurrence in 11%. CONCLUSIONS: sRARP is technically more challenging but is a feasible option in high-volume centres for treatment of recurrent PCa. Patients should be counselled that functional outcomes are inferior to primary RARP. Adjustment of surgical technique according to the primary treatment is key for good surgical outcomes. PATIENT SUMMARY: We report our experience with sRARP for the management of localised PCa recurrence after primary treatment. This represents a feasible approach with acceptable peri-operative complications and cancer outcomes. Functional outcomes are inferior to RARP in the primary setting.",UNKNOWN,FALSE,UNKNOWN,73

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 7 institutions for 14,220 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with LDR brachytherapy, either alone (8552) or with external beam radiotherapy (n = 1175), androgen deprivation (n = 3165), or both (n = 1328), were analyzed. Risk distribution was 42.4% favorable, 49.2% intermediate, and 8.4% high-risk. Patients with clinical failure before 3.5 years were excluded. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used with clinical failure (local, distant, regional or biochemical triggering salvage) as an endpoint for each of four PSA categories: PSA ≤ 0.2, >0.2 to ≤0.5, >0.5 to ≤1.0, and >1.0 ng/mL. PSA levels at 4 years (±6 months) in 8746 patients without clinical failure were correlated with disease status at 10-15 years. RESULTS: For the 77.1% of patients with 4-year PSA ≤ 0.2, the freedom-from-recurrence (FFR) rates were 98.7% (95% CI 98.3-99.0) at 10 years and 96.1% (95% CI 94.8-97.2) at 15 years. Three independent validation cohorts confirmed 97-99% 10-year FFR rates with 4-year PSA ≤ 0.2. Successive PSA categories were associated with diminished disease-free rates at 10 and 15 years. PSA category was strongly associated with treatment success (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Since 98.7% of patients with PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at 4 years after LDR prostate brachytherapy were disease-free beyond 10 years, we suggest adopting this biochemical definition of cure for patients with ≥4 years' follow-up after LDR brachytherapy.",FALSE,N/A,UNKNOWN,60

Epub 2020 Feb 12.,Connor MJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051551,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer focal therapy aims to minimize the side-effects of whole gland treatments, such as radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy without compromising oncological efficacy. However, concerns exist regarding the multifocal nature of prostate cancer and the lack of long-term oncological data for this form of treatment. In recent years, the routine adoption of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate has improved our ability to select candidates for focal therapy and to accurately deliver this form of prostate cancer treatment. METHODS: We performed a review of the literature to provide a summary of the oncological and functional outcomes of men receiving primary prostate focal therapy. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the routine implementation of mpMRI as part of the initial prostate cancer diagnostic pathway on the selection of candidates and delivery of focal therapy. Finally, we summarize knowledge gaps in the field and highlight active clinical trials in this arena. RESULTS: Primary focal therapy involves the application of one of a number of energies that ablate tissue, such as cryotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Success is principally dependent on highly accurate patient selection and disease localization underpinned in large part by the routine integration of pre-biopsy mpMRI. Prospective medium-term follow-up data for primary HIFU and cryotherapy for men with intermediate-risk disease have shown acceptable cancer control with low risk of side effects and complications. Additional research is needed to clearly define an appropriate follow-up approach and to guide the management of in- and out-of-field recurrences. Multiple comparative trials with randomization against standard care are currently underway in men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: The widespread adoption of prostate mpMRI has led to improved disease localization, enabling the performance of focal therapy as a viable treatment strategy for men with low volume intermediate-risk prostate cancer.",FALSE,N/A,TRUE,80

Preoperative assessment revealed 28 cases of cT2a and seven cases of cT2b disease. All patients were continent preoperatively (defined as no pad required or one dry pad per day as a precaution). Surgical results and peri-operative complications were assessed. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean operating time was 150 ± 35 min. Estimated blood loss was 100 ± 45 mL. Urinary infection was noted in one patient and managed with levofloxacin. Another patient complained of nocturia on postoperative day 14, which was relieved with solifenacin succinate. Urethral catheters were removed on postoperative day 7. Thirty-two patients achieved immediate urinary continence, with three patients returning to full continence on postoperative day 14. Postoperative pathology confirmed 24 pT2a cases, nine pT2b cases and two pT2c cases (median [IQR] Gleason score 6 [6-7]). Positive surgical margins were found in four patients (11.4%). No urethral stricture or urinary leakage was noted on urethrocystography taken 3 months after surgery. Urodynamic studies were performed preoperatively and 6 months after surgery: median (IQR) maximum urinary flow 12.2 (10.2-14.9) vs 13.7 (10.1-15.0) mL/s; bladder capacity 385.3 (351.3-410.2) vs 370.2 (330.1-395.4) mL; and voiding phase detrusor contractility 38.5 (27.8-42.3) vs 35.6 (28.3-41.3) mmH<sub>2</sub> O, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single institution phase IIS pilot study of patients treated with focal 4D Brachytherapy™ (BXTAccelyon, Burnham, Buckinghamshire, UK). The primary outcome was patient-reported toxicity 24 months after implant. The secondary outcome was assessment of disease control. Outcomes in HG patients were compared to whole-gland (WG) controls obtained from our prospective cohort registry by negative binomial and linear regression models. RESULTS: Pre-treatment demography was similar between the 30 HG patients and 362 WG controls. Post-implant dosimetry was similar for the prostate gland target volumes and significantly reduced for the urethra and bowel in HG patients relative to WG controls, but this did not translate into a difference in post-implant mean symptom scores between the two groups. Nevertheless, the change in score from baseline indicated that the impact on pre-treatment symptom status was less after HG implants. Only HG patients showed a return to baseline urinary scores as early as 12 months. Sexual potency was conserved in 73% and 67% of HG and WG patients, respectively (P = 0.84). Post-implant prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics revealed that baseline PSA was reduced at 24 months by 78% and 88% in HG and WG patients, respectively (P < 0.05).

Similarly, a number of secondary endpoints ranging from cancer-specific outcomes to quality-of-life outcomes are being investigated. The inclusion criteria in these trials also varied in terms of volume of metastatic disease (oligometastatic to high-volume metastatic disease), diagnosis of metastases (imaging based vs biopsy confirmed), imaging modalities used (conventional to newer modalities), as well as outcomes and follow-up regimes.

Epub 2020 May 31.,Becher E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32487352,"Historically, the primary objection to partial gland ablation (PGA) for management of prostate cancer (CaP) has been disease multifocality and inability to localize significant disease. Improved disease localization and risk stratification with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy, along with its minimal adverse impact on quality of life has enabled PGA to gain acceptance. Today, the primary barrier for adopting PGA is its unknown oncological outcomes. Objectives of this review are to provide a rationale for PGA for managing intermediate-risk (IR) CaP; review oncological outcomes following PGA for IR disease; and assess whether there is adequate data to justify PGA for management of IR CaP. There is no consensus how to assess or define oncological outcomes following PGA. We propose the following definitions for oncological outcomes: Oncological control (detection of any cancer following biopsy), oncological failure (detection of Gleason grade group >1 on follow-up biopsy), and oncological treatment failure (any disease that precipitate salvage treatment). There are only 3 reports in the literature where inclusion criteria specified pretreatment targeted biopsy and reflex prostate biopsy within 1 year of PGA in cohorts of men where >50% had Gleason grade group >1 disease. These studies reported that prostate-specific antigen is not a reliable surrogate and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is reliable when prevalence of in-field CaP is high. ""Freedom from failure"" is used to assess longer-term oncologic outcomes, and is defined by freedom from CaP mortality, androgen deprivation therapy, or whole-gland treatment. Rationale for PGA in selected cases of IR CaP is compelling and early oncological studies are reassuring. If patient selection is done judiciously, oncologic outcomes are disclosed, and follow-up plan is rigorously implemented, it is unlikely rates of metastasis or CaP mortality with be adversely impacted and many men will avoid or defer adverse effects of whole-gland treatment.",TRUE,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,63

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This population-based nationwide cohort study utilized data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2013. The patients were divided into three groups-those who received ADT only (ADT-only group), those who had radiotherapy (RT) only (RT-only group), and those treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) only (RP-only group). The study outcome was newly diagnosed hematologic disorder, including anemia and hematologic malignancy. Propensity score-matched, Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier curve analyses were performed to investigate the risk of subsequently developing hematologic disorders after ADT.

Retrospective studies suggest a variable clinic course for patients with pN+ prostate cancer. Some men progress rapidly to metastatic disease despite further therapies, whereas other men can have a period of prolonged quiescence without adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or radiation therapy (RT). For men who have undergone radical prostatectomy, randomized trial data indicate that the addition of ADT in pN+ disease extends metastasis-free, prostate cancer-specific, and overall survival. Additional retrospective studies suggest that adding RT is potentially beneficial in this setting, improving overall and cancer-specific survival especially in men with certain pathologic parameters. Conversely, men with lower disease burden in their lymph nodes have longer times to progression and may be candidates for observation and salvage therapy as opposed to adjuvant ADT/RT.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,100

Epub 2019 Mar 8.,Daly T,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30850855,"PURPOSE: Although the clinical significance of a diagnosis of prostate cancer for some men is debated, for many men it leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Radical treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer has been shown to improve survival in men with intermediate or high-risk disease. There is no high level evidence to support the superiority of radical prostatectomy, with or without adjuvant or salvage external beam radiotherapy in comparison to definitive radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation, and the choice should be individualized. External beam radiation therapy practices are in constant evolution, and numerous strategies have been investigated to improve either efficacy or reduce toxicity, or both. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials investigating strategies to improve efficacy, reduce toxicity, or both of external beam radiotherapy have been reviewed in men with prostate cancer without nodal or distant metastases. These strategies include the use of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant androgen deprivation, dose-escalation, hypofractionation, whole pelvic radiation therapy, incorporation of improved imaging, image- guided radiation therapy, and adjuvant systemic therapy. The evidence to date for these strategies is discussed, noting limitations in applying the results of reported trials to men treated in contemporary settings. RESULTS: A number of strategies have shown improvements in biochemical control using external beam radiotherapy. To date, only with the use of androgen deprivation therapy has this translated into improvements in disease specific and overall survival. This may reflect the long natural history of prostate cancer and high incidence of competing risks. Technological advances have enabled dose escalation with reduced toxicity, of paramount importance given the long natural history. RESULTS: The use of external beam radiation therapy in prostate cancer is evolving with numerous strategies incorporated to improve outcomes. The optimum dose and fractionation and use of androgen deprivation or systemic adjuvants for each man is unclear based on current evidence and prognostic and predictive parameters. Patient preferences play an important role in chosen therapy. It is hoped that future studies better capture all prostate cancer- and treatment- related morbidity to clarify the optimal therapy choices for each man with prostate cancer.",FALSE,N/A,UNKNOWN,98

In this review, we present data on oncological outcomes and on acute and late sequelae, as far as these are currently known, in patients with head and neck tumors (HNT) or prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent repeat radiotherapy after prior radiotherapy with curative intent. METHODS: This review is based on clinical series with over 20 patients that were published between May 1998 and April 2018 (HNT) or between October 1998 and October 2018 (PCa) and were retrieved by a search in the PubMed database. RESULTS: Most of the clinical series retrieved were retrospective and uncontrolled. There were 16 studies that included 2678 patients with recurrent head and neck tumors, and 8 that included 245 patients with recurrent prostate cancer. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, intensity-modulated radio - therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) yielded three-year survival rates of 47-57% but also produced substantial acute and late adverse effects. Most of the studies concerning recurrent PCa involved small patient groups. In these studies, repeat radiotherapy with SBRT yielded tumor control rates of 40-80% after 11-24 months of follow-up, with only mild acute toxicity. CONCLUSION: Although no comparative studies are available, it seems that modern external beam radiotherapy techniques can be used for repeat radiotherapy of locally recurrent head and neck tumors with curative intent after careful patient selection. Repeat radiotherapy of PCa must still be considered experimental, but initial results from small-scale trials are encouraging. The long-term adverse effects cannot yet be accessed. Patients should be selected by an interdisciplinary tumor board. This type of treatment is generally carried out in a specialized center.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,68

METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare, we identified men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2007 and 2011. We created physician-hospital networks by assigning each patient to a physician and each physician to a hospital based on treatment patterns. We assessed content validity by examining characteristics of hospitals anchoring the physician-hospital networks and of the patients associated with these hospitals. RESULTS: We identified 42,963 patients associated with 344 physician-hospital networks. Networks anchored by a teaching hospital (compared to a nonteaching hospital) had higher median numbers of prostate cancer patients (117 [interquartile range {71-189} vs 82 {50-126}]) and treating physicians (7 [4-11] vs 4 [3-6]) (both P <0.001). On average, patients traveled farther to networks anchored by a teaching hospital (49 miles [standard deviation] [207] vs 41 [183]; P <.001). Hospitals known as high-volume centers for robotic prostatectomies, proton-beam therapy, and active surveillance had network rates for these procedures well above the mean.

Epub 2019 Nov 14.,Depauw N,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31734604,"PURPOSE: Treatment planning for proton therapy requires the relative proton stopping power ratio (RSP) information of the patient for accurate dose calculations. RSP are conventionally obtained after mapping of the Hounsfield units (HU) from a calibrated patient computed tomography (CT). One or multiple CT are needed for a given treatment which represents additional, undesired dose to the patient. For prostate cancer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are the gold standard for segmentation while offering dose-less imaging. We here quantify the clinical applicability of converted MR images as a substitute for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatment of the prostate. METHODS: MRCAT (Magnetic Resonance for Calculating ATtenuation) is a Philips-developed technology which produces a synthetic CT image consisting of five HU from a specific set of MRI acquisitions. MRCAT and original planning CT data sets were obtained for ten patients. An IMPT plan was generated on the MRCAT for each patient. Plans were produced such that they fulfill the prostate protocol in use at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The plans were then recomputed onto the nominal planning CT for each patient. Robustness analyses (±5 mm setup shifts and ±3.5 % range uncertainties) were also performed. RESULTS: Comparison of MRCAT plans and their recomputation onto the planning CT plan showed excellent agreement. Likewise, dose perturbations due to setup shifts and range uncertainties were well within clinical acceptance demonstrating the clinical viability of the approach. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrate the clinical acceptability of substituting MR converted RSP images instead of CT for IMPT planning of prostate cancer. This further translates into higher contouring accuracy along with lesser imaging dose.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,50

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with biochemical relapse after non-surgical primary treatment for localised prostate cancer were selected after a negative screen for metastatic disease. Template mapping biopsies combined with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were used to identify the location of the tumour and the focal clinical target volume. The planning aim dose prescription was 19 Gy. Outcome measures were biochemical relapse-free survival and toxicity using International Prostate Symptom Score and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) scores. RESULTS: Between March 2013 and December 2018, 50 patients underwent salvage HDR brachytherapy. The median follow-up was 21 months (range 1-53). Biochemical progression-free survival at 2 and 3 years was 63% and 46%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, only prostate-specific antigen nadir ≤0.5 ng/ml post-salvage (P = 0.03, hazard ratio 0.04) was associated with biochemical progression-free survival. Relapse was associated with distant metastases in 11/13 patients in whom this was investigated. Late grade 3 genitourinary toxicities were gross haematuria (three patients), severe lower urinary tract symptoms (two patients), erectile dysfunction (one patient) and urethral stricture requiring surgery (four patients).

The present review aimed to provide a framework on the latest evidences on outcomes of prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) vs. open radical prostatectomy (ORP). Specifically, we focused on postoperative complications, urinary continence and erectile function recovery, PCa recurrence and PCa-related mortality. RECENT FINDINGS: Regarding perioperative outcomes, recent studies confirmed lower blood loss, transfusion rates and shorter catheterization time for RARP compared with ORP. Postoperative complications are lower in retrospective analyses, but this trend was not confirmed in prospective studies. Functional outcomes are comparable between RARP and ORP, with a slight nonclinically meaningful benefit in favour of RARP. The mid-term update of a recent randomized trial showed better oncological outcomes at 24 months, but the strength of this finding is limited by methodological flaws. Conversely, contemporary retrospective studies did not demonstrate differences in terms of biochemical recurrence between the two surgical approaches.

This paper describes a fast robust optimization tool that takes advantage of the GPU parallel computing technologies. The new robust optimization model is based on nine boundary dose distributions - two for ±range uncertainties, six for ±set-up uncertainties along anteroposterior (A-P), lateral (R-L) and superior-inferior (S-I) directions, and one for nominal situation. The nine boundary influence matrices were calculated using an in-house finite size pencil beam dose engine, while the conjugate gradient method was applied to minimize the objective function. The proton dose calculation algorithm and the conjugate gradient method were tuned for heterogeneous platforms involving the CPU host and GPU device. Three clinical cases - one head and neck cancer case, one lung cancer case, and one prostate cancer case - were investigated to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the proposed robust optimizer. Compared with results from Varian Eclipse (version 13.3), the proposed method is found to be conducive to robust treatment planning that is less sensitive to range and setup uncertainties. The three tested cases show that targets can achieve high dose uniformity while organs at risks (OARs) are in better protection against setup and range errors. Based on the CPU + GPU heterogeneous platform, the execution times of the head and neck cancer case and the prostate cancer case are much less than half of Eclipse, while the run time of the lung cancer case is similar to that of Eclipse. The fast robust optimizer developed in this study can improve the reliability of traditional proton treatment planning in a much faster speed, thus making it possible for clinical utility.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,50

Therefore, in this study, we proposed a ""Dr. Answer"" AI software based on the clinical outcome prediction model for prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. METHODS: The Dr. Answer AI was developed based on a clinical outcome prediction model, with a user-friendly interface. We used 7,128 clinical data of prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy from three hospitals. An outcome prediction model was developed to calculate the probability of occurrence of 1) tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging, 2) extracapsular extension, 3) seminal vesicle invasion, and 4) lymph node metastasis. Random forest and k-nearest neighbors algorithms were used, and the proposed system was compared with previous algorithms. RESULTS: Random forest exhibited good performance for TNM staging (recall value: 76.98%), while k-nearest neighbors exhibited good performance for extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node metastasis (80.24%, 98.67%, and 95.45%, respectively).

The aim of this study is to review the potential of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the management of oligometastatic prostate cancer and to compare treatment outcomes with SBRT to those under standard of care management regarding progression-free survival (PFS), androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival and local control rate (LCR) as well as a comparison of toxicity profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched to identify prospective randomised controlled trials as well as retrospective studies investigating SBRT and standard of care management for oligometastatic prostate cancer. Data on treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included: 14 reported on the use of SBRT and four reported on the use of standard of care management. For SBRT, median PFS was 7.36-24 months. Median ADT-free survival was 12.3-39.7 months. The LCR varied, with some reports of 100% at 6 months and others of 92% at 5 years. No significant grade 3 toxicity was reported, with only five grade 3 events reported in two studies. For standard of care management, most of the studies reported 3-year PFS of 46.9-58.6%, with one study reporting a median PFS of 38.6 months. No standard of care study reported on LCR and ADT-free survival. Although different toxicity grading systems were used depending on the treatment modality, there were some reports of grade 3 events using standard of care management. CONCLUSION: SBRT appears to be a safe and effective modality for treating oligometastatic prostate cancer, having the potential to defer palliative ADT. Although LCR is excellent compared to conventional therapies, the PFS rate is reportedly inferior to standard of care therapies. No significant grade 3 toxicity was observed with SBRT.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,78

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified robot-assisted radical prostatectomies for clinically localized (cT1-2N0M0) prostate cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 in the National Cancer Database. We categorized annual average hospital robot-assisted radical prostatectomy volume into very low, low, medium, high and very high by most closely sorting the final included patients into 5 equal-sized groups (quintiles). Outcomes included 30-day mortality, 90-day mortality, conversion (to open), prolonged length of stay (more than 2 days), 30-day (unplanned) readmission, positive surgical margin and lymph node dissection rates. RESULTS: A total of 114,957 patients were included in the study, and hospital volume was categorized into very low (3 to 45 cases per year), low (46 to 72), medium (73 to 113), high (114 to 218) and very high (219 or more). Overall 30-day mortality (0.12%), 90-day mortality (0.16%) and conversion rates (0.65%) were low. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that compared with the very low volume group, higher hospital volume was associated with lower odds of conversion to open surgery (OR 0.23, p <0.001 for very high), prolonged length of stay (OR 0.25, p <0.001 for very high), 30-day readmission (OR 0.53, p <0.001 for very high) and positive surgical margins (OR 0.61, p <0.001 for very high). Higher hospital volume was also associated with higher odds of lymph node dissection in the intermediate/high risk cohort (OR 3.23, p <0.001 for very high). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at higher volume hospitals are likely to have improved perioperative and superior oncologic outcomes compared to lower volume hospitals.",FALSE,N/A,UNKNOWN,65

High-dose radiation has been demonstrated to stimulate the immune system in various human solid tumors. We hypothesized that localized radiation therapy, in the form of high dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRBT), would overcome immune suppression in PCa. METHODS: To investigate whether HDRBT altered prostate immune context, we analyzed preradiation versus postradiation human tissue from a cohort of 24 patients with localized PCa that received HDRBT as primary treatment (RadBank cohort). We performed Nanostring immune gene expression profiling, digital spatial profiling, and high-throughput immune cell multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis. We also resolved tumor and nontumor zones in spatial and bioinformatic analyses to explore the immunological response. RESULTS: Nanostring immune profiling revealed numerous immune checkpoint molecules (eg, B7-H3, CTLA4, PDL1, and PDL2) and TGFβ levels were increased in response to HDRBT. We used a published 16-gene tumor inflammation signature (TIS) to divide tumors into distinct immune activation states (high:<i>hot</i>, intermediate and low:<i>cold</i>) and showed that most localized PCa are cold tumors pre-HDRBT. Crucially, HDRBT converted 80% of these 'cold'-phenotype tumors into an 'intermediate' or 'hot' class. We used digital spatial profiling to show these HDRBT-induced changes in prostate TIS scores were derived from the nontumor regions. Furthermore, these changes in TIS were also associated with pervasive changes in immune cell density and spatial relationships-in particular, between T cell subsets and antigen presenting cells. We identified an increased density of CD4<sup>+</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages and CD68<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells in response to HDRBT. The only subset change specific to tumor zones was PDL1<sup>-</sup> macrophages. While these immune responses were heterogeneous, HDRBT induced significant changes in immune cell associations, including a gained T cell and HMWCK<sup>+</sup> PDL1<sup>+</sup> interaction in tumor zones. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we showed HDRBT converted ""cold"" prostate tumors into more immunologically activated ""hot"" tissues, with accompanying spatially organized immune infiltrates and signaling changes. Understanding and potentially harnessing these changes will have widespread implications for the future treatment of localized PCa, including rational use of combination radio-immunotherapy.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,60

Utilizing a provincial population-based linked data set from an equal-access, universal health care system, we sought to compare outcomes among patients treated with either radiation or prostatectomy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study by linking several administrative data sets to identify patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2016 in Manitoba, Canada and who were subsequently treated with either RP or RT. Cox proportional hazard models with inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to compare rates of all-cause mortality, as well as prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM) between patients who underwent RP vs RT. RESULTS: During the study period, 2,540 patients underwent RP and 1,895 underwent RT for prostate cancer. Unadjusted overall survival was higher for RP vs RT (5-year overall survival 95.52% for RP compared with 84.55% for RT, p <0.0001). In inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted Cox regression analysis, compared to patients in the RP groups, patients in the RT group had an increased rate of all-cause mortality (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.65-2.26, p <0.0001), and PCSM (HR 3.98, 95% CI 2.89-5.49; p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: RT was associated with higher all-cause mortality and PCSM rates compared with RP.

The only data available until now on the utility of a peritoneal flap to prevent lymphocele were retrospectively acquired. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, multi-center trial with blinded assessment of endpoints was carried out on 232 patients with prostate cancer who underwent RARP with PLND. The patients in the intervention group were given a peritoneal flap; in the control group, surgery was performed without this modification. The two joint primary endpoints were the rates of symptomatic lymphocele during the same hospitalization as the operative procedure (iT1) and within 90 days of surgery (iT2). The secondary endpoints were lymphocele volume, the need for treatment of lymphocele, complications requiring an intervention, and the degree of postoperative stress incontinence. German Clinical Trials Register number: DRKS00011115. RESULTS: The data were evaluated in an intention-to-treat analysis, which, in this trial, was identical to an as-treated analysis. 108 patients (46.6%) were allotted to the intervention group. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences with respect to any clinical or histopathological criteria. A median of 16 lymph nodes were removed (interquartile range, 11-21). A symptomatic lymphocele arose in 1.3% (iT1) and 9.1% (iT2) of the patients, without any statistically significant difference between the two trial groups (p = 0.599 and p = 0.820, respectively).

The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of RT technique (3D-CRT vs IMRT/VMAT) on the incidence of second tumors in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. METHODS: A retrospective study on 2526 previously irradiated PCa patients was performed. Patients were treated with 3D-CRT (21.3%), IMRT (68.1%), or VMAT (10.6%). Second tumors incidence was analysed in 3 categories: pelvic, pelvic and abdominal, and ""any site"". The correlation with RT technique was analysed using log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazard method. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 72 months (range: 9-185), 92 (3.6%) cases of second tumors were recorded with 48 months (range: 9-152) median interval from RT. Actuarial 10-year second tumor free survival (STFS) was 87.3%. Ten-year STFS in patients treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT/VMAT was 85.8 and 84.5%, respectively (p: .627). A significantly higher 10-year cumulative incidence of second tumors in the pelvis was registered in patients treated with IMRT/VMAT compared to 3D-CRT (10.7% vs 6.0%; p: .033). The lower incidence of second pelvic cancers in patients treated with 3D-CRT was confirmed at multivariable analysis (HR: 2.42, 95%CI: 1.07-5.47, p: .034).

The treatment outcome of early-stage prostate cancer is excellent, but such a radical treatment also leaves the patient with undesired adverse consequences. To resolve such problems, attention should be paid to active surveillance as a modern treatment option. This study aimed to systematically review the literature about quality of life in prostate cancer patients undergoing active surveillance. Evidence was acquired from PubMed databases in March 2019 using quality of life, prostate cancer, well-being, anxiety, depression, stress, outcomes, active surveillance, radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy as keywords. Five clinical active surveillance studies measured health-related quality of life and related psychological factors, and seven compared active surveillance with other treatments (radical therapy and hormone therapy). Active surveillance was superior to radical therapy for urinary and sexual function. Furthermore, most patients who opted for active surveillance showed lower anxiety and fear of progression, whereas health-related quality of life was maintained. Although active surveillance has the advantage of being non-invasive, its diagnosis and follow-up protocols are unreliable. Because such uncertainty can affect patients' quality of life, utilization of imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, and the development of new biomarkers are required.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,65

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with localised prostate cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 and treated with either RALP or RT. Baseline patient and disease characteristics, post-treatment complications, and latest disease status were retrospectively collected from hospital records. For assessment of patient-reported outcomes, the Chinese version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire was completed by the patients. RESULTS: Ninety three patients aged 58 to 84 years were recruited. Thirty patients were treated by RALP (32.3%), whereas 63 received RT (67.7%). The RALP group had significantly lower baseline prostate-specific antigen levels than the RT group (P<0.001). More patients who underwent RALP reported urinary incontinence (70.0% vs 3.2%, P<0.001), whereas more patients who underwent RT reported other voiding symptoms (87.3% vs 50.0%, P<0.001) and perirectal bleeding (36.5% vs 0%, P<0.001) during follow-up. Of the 85 patients who were still alive at the time of the study, 52 (61.2%) returned completed questionnaires. Patients who underwent RALP had poorer median (interquartile range) EPIC urinary summary scores than patients who underwent RT [81.5 (18.3) vs 88.9 (17.9), P=0.016]. Urinary function [75.9 (20.4) vs 93.6 (16.2), P<0.001] and incontinence [60.5 (31.8) vs 91.8 (14.5), P<0.001] were also significantly worse in the RALP group. The bowel and sexual domain scores were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found that RALP and RT were associated with different patterns of complications and patient-reported outcomes. Urinary incontinence was much more prevalent in the patients treated surgically. This may significantly affect patients' quality of life.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,55

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of NADT on patient's long-term recovery following surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From March 2011 to August 2013, 5808 men with newly diagnosed prostate were followed up to 24 mo. A cohort of men who received NADT prior to robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP; n=51) was compared 1:3 with a matched group that underwent RALP only (n=153). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patients were matched on Charlson comorbidities, biopsy Gleason score, and node status on final pathology. The Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the groups on their bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal domains of the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo postoperatively. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The urinary irritative, urinary incontinence, and bowel domains were similar in the two groups during the 24 mo (p=0.832, 0.901, and 0.732, respectively). In the hormonal domain, the NADT group did worse (p<0.001). The sexual domain was also worse for the NADT group. However, when accounting for nerve sparing, there was no significant difference in sexual outcomes between the two groups (p=0.069). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received NADT prior to RALP do not have worse sexual function, but have worse hormonal scores for up to 2yr after surgery.

To assess nationwide trends, the authors analyzed 392,710 men with prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The primary endpoint was treatment choice as a function of pretreatment demographics. RESULTS: Univariate analyses revealed similar treatment trends in the MultiD and SEER cohorts. The use of procedural forms of definitive therapy decreased with age, including brachytherapy and prostatectomy (all P < .05). Later year of diagnosis/clinic visit was associated with decreased use of definitive treatments, whereas higher risk grouping was associated with increased use (all P < .001). Patients with low-risk disease treated at the MultiD clinic were more likely to receive nondefinitive therapy than patients in SEER, whereas the opposite trend was observed for patients with high-risk disease, with a substantial portion of high-risk patients in SEER not receiving definitive therapy. In the MultiD clinic, African American men with intermediate-risk and high-risk disease were more likely to receive definitive therapy than white men, but for SEER the opposite was true.

MicroRNA expression is altered in prostate cancer and may promote therapy resistance. Through bioinformatic analyses of TCGA and CPC-GENE patient cohorts, we identified higher miR-191 expression in tumor versus normal tissue, and increased expression in higher Gleason scores. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-191 overexpression promotes radiation survival, and contributes to a more aggressive phenotype. Retinoid X receptor alpha, RXRA, was discovered to be a novel target of miR-191, and knockdown recapitulated radioresistance. Furthermore, treatment of prostate cancer cells with the RXRA agonist 9-cis-retinoic acid restored radiosensitivity. Supporting this relationship, patients with high miR-191 and low RXRA abundance experienced quicker biochemical recurrence. Reduced RXRA translated to a higher risk of distant failure after radiotherapy. Notably, this miR-191/RXRA interaction was conserved in a novel primary cell line derived from radiorecurrent prostate cancer. Together, our findings demonstrate that miR-191 promotes prostate cancer survival after radiotherapy, and highlights retinoids as a potential option to improve radiotherapy response.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,71

The aim of this retrospective study is to report oncologic outcome and toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) in PCa patients affected by pelvic nodal oligorecurrence. METHODS: 41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients. Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered using tomotherapy. 83% of the patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with ENRT. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.

Several improvements in the radiotherapy field allow the delivery of higher doses/fractions with a safe toxicity profile, permitting the reduction of radiation treatment protocols in the elderly. Regarding breast, prostate, and lung cancer, the under-representation of older patients in clinical trials limits the extension of treatment recommendations to elderly patients in routine clinical practice. Among the feasible alternatives to standard whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) in older patients are shorter courses using higher hypofractionation (HF) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). The boost continues to be used in women at high risk of local recurrence but is less widely accepted for women at lower risk and patients over 70 years of age. Regarding prostate cancer, there are no published studies with a focus on the elderly. Current management decisions are based on life expectancy and geriatric assessment. Regimens of HF and ultra-HF protocols are feasible strategies for older patients. Several prospective non-randomized studies have documented the safe delivery of ultra-HF for patients with localized prostate cancer, and multiple phase III trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that the HF regimen should be offered with similar acute toxicity regardless of patient age and comorbidity. A recent pooled analysis from two randomized trials comparing surgery to stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in older adult patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer did show comparable outcomes between surgery and SBRT. Elderly cancer patients are significantly under-represented in all clinical trials. Thus, the inclusion of older patients in clinical studies should be strongly encouraged to strengthen the evidence base for this age group. We suggest that the creation of oncogeriatric coordination units may promote individualized care protocols, avoid overtreatment with aggressive and unrecommended therapies, and support de-escalating treatment in elderly cancer patients.",TRUE,UNKNOWN,TRUE,90

METHODS: In this cohort study, we enrolled eligible patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at our center between 2001 and 2018. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative biochemical failure, defined as two consecutive PSA levels >= 0.2 ng/dl. Patients with TNM stage >= III, Gleason score >=8, or baseline PSA above our calculated cut-off level were considered as high risk. Kaplan-Meier survival method and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were used for determining the biochemical relapse-free survival and its predictors. RESULTS: Data of 959 patients (age=61.2 ± 6.4 years) were analyzed with a median follow up of 36 months (range 6 months to 18 years). A total of 97 patients (10.1%) developed biochemical failure at the time of analysis who had a significantly older age and longer follow-up duration (P=0.024 and P<0.001, respectively).

RESULTS: Among all patients with brain metastases, the proportion originating from prostate adenocarcinoma was 0.86%. The median age at the time of brain metastasis diagnosis was 69 (range, 57-90). The median original Gleason score was 8 (range, 6-10), and the median prostate-specific antigen at the time of brain metastasis was 60 ng/mL (range, 0.34-4600). The median months from initial cancer diagnosis to brain metastasis was 81 (range, 3-195). The median number of brain metastases was 2 (range, 1-5). Patients had concurrent metastases to bone (100%), lung (48%), and liver (35%). Median overall survival was 3 months (range, 0.4-25.0). Treatment of the brain metastases was correlated with an increase in median survival from 1.2 months to 4.6 months with radiosurgery (hazard ratio = 0.11, P = 0.001) and surgical resection plus radiotherapy to 13 months (hazard ratio = 0.05, P < 0.001). All patients died of advanced, systemic disease and not of their intracranial disease. CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastasis from prostate cancer constitutes a small fraction of total brain metastases, but is associated with poor prognosis and is seen in the setting of advanced, castrate resistant disease. These data enable treating physicians to appropriately counsel their patients with prostate adenocarcinoma brain metastasis.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,73

The aim of this study was to compare sexual functions of PCa patients before and after intensity-modulated RT and to analyze their correlation with penile bulb (PB) doses and patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients who underwent RT ± hormone therapy for PCa between 2010 and 2013 were analyzed. Sexual functions assessed by patient-reported questionnaire and physician reported scale before and 3 years after treatment. The effect of patients' age, prostate volume, testosterone levels, comorbidity, smoking status, tumor stage, RT technique, hormone therapy, and PB doses to sexual functions were investigated. RESULTS: After 3 years of RT, 64.3% of all patients had a lower erectile score; and 75% of patients who were previously potent (n = 24) had become impotent after treatment. However sexual desire still remained in 75.8% of patients who had desire before treatment (n = 33). Statistical analysis showed that two parameters were correlated with postradiotherapy impotency outcome; PB mean radiation dose (P = 0.033) and testosterone levels (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: RT, despite modern techniques, affects the sexual function of PCa patients in varying degrees. Reducing radiation doses to penile structures may play a role in preventing erectile dysfunction.",UNKNOWN,FALSE,UNKNOWN,55

Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-based stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is emerging as an alternative option to postpone starting ADT and its associated side effects including the development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to determine progression free-survival (PFS) and treatment failure free-survival (TFFS) after PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT in OMPC patients. The efficacy and safety of single fraction radiosurgery (SFRS) and ADT delay were investigated. METHODS: Patients with ≤5 metastases from OMPC, with/without ADT treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT were retrospectively analyzed. PFS and TFFS were primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and ADT-free survival (ADTFS). RESULTS: Fifty patients with a total of 75 metastases detected by PSMA-PET/CT were analyzed. At the time of SBRT, 70% of patients were castration-sensitive. Overall, 80% of metastases were treated with SFRS (median dose 20 Gy, range: 16-25). After median follow-up of 34 months (range: 5-70) median PFS and TFFS were 12 months (range: 2-63) and 14 months (range: 2-70), respectively. Thirty-two (64%) patients had repeat oligometastatic disease. Twenty-four (48%) patients with progression underwent second SBRT course. Two-year LC after SFRS was 96%. Grade 1 and 2 toxicity occurred in 3 (6%) and 1 (2%) patients, respectively. ADTFS and OS rates at 2-years were 60.5% and 100%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, TFFS significantly improved in patients with time to first metastasis (TTM) >36 months (p = 0.01) and PSA before SBRT ≤1 ng/ml (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: For patients with OMPC, SBRT might be used as an alternative to ADT. This way, the start/escalation of palliative ADT and its side effects can be deferred. Metastases treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based SFRS reached excellent LC with minimal toxicity. Low PSA levels and longer TTM predict elongated TFFS.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,68

We report the clinical outcomes of 260 patients treated with high-dose IGRT as well as the toxicity of high-dose IGRT in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2008 to February 2012, 260 men with clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical radiotherapy. Two hundred patients were treated with IMRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions) to the prostate and base of seminal vesicles using an adaptive protocol combining cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and kilovoltage image matching with individualized safety margin calculation. Sixty patients underwent treatment with the same prescribed dose using RapidArc with a reduced safety margin of 6 mm and daily online matching using CBCT. Late toxicity was scored prospectively according to the RTOG/FC-LENT scale. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (6.9%) experienced acute grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity. There was no acute grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity. Thirty-nine patients (15%) experienced acute grade 2 genitourinary toxicity and 6 patients (2.3%) had grade 3 gerourinary toxicity. Genitourinary toxicity grade 4 was observed in 5 (1.9%) patients, due to installation of a urinary catheter. At a median follow up of 84.2 months, the estimated 7-year cumulative incidences of grade 2 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity were 4.4 and 7.1% respectively. The estimated 7-year prostate specific antigen relapse free survival was 97.1% for low-risk disease, 83.6% for intermediate-risk disease and 75% for high-risk patients.

Epub 2020 Jan 27.,Gillessen S,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32001144,"BACKGROUND: Innovations in treatments, imaging, and molecular characterisation in advanced prostate cancer have improved outcomes, but there are still many aspects of management that lack high-level evidence to inform clinical practice. The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2019 addressed some of these topics to supplement guidelines that are based on level 1 evidence. OBJECTIVE: To present the results from the APCCC 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Similar to prior conferences, experts identified 10 important areas of controversy regarding the management of advanced prostate cancer: locally advanced disease, biochemical recurrence after local therapy, treating the primary tumour in the metastatic setting, metastatic hormone-sensitive/naïve prostate cancer, nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, bone health and bone metastases, molecular characterisation of tissue and blood, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, and adverse effects of hormonal therapy and their management. A panel of 72 international prostate cancer experts developed the programme and the consensus questions. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 123 predefined questions, which were developed by both voting and nonvoting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Panellists voted based on their opinions rather than a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions had varying degrees of support by the panel, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results reported in the Supplementary material. CONCLUSIONS: These voting results from a panel of prostate cancer experts can help clinicians and patients navigate controversial areas of advanced prostate management for which high-level evidence is sparse. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient-specific factors, such as disease extent and location, prior lines of therapy, comorbidities, and treatment preferences, together with current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic constraints. Clinical trial enrolment for men with advanced prostate cancer should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2019 once again identified important questions that merit assessment in specifically designed trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference, which has been held three times since 2015, aims to share the knowledge of world experts in prostate cancer management with health care providers worldwide. At the end of the conference, an expert panel discusses and votes on predefined consensus questions that target the most clinically relevant areas of advanced prostate cancer treatment. The results of the voting provide a practical guide to help clinicians discuss therapeutic options with patients as part of shared and multidisciplinary decision making.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,TRUE,63

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-center prospectively collected data on patients with prostate cancer who underwent primary focal high intensity focused ultrasound from January 2016 to July 2018 were included. All patients underwent a 12-core biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion biopsy depending on the presence of targetable lesions. Any Grade Group was allowed, however only patients with localized disease were included. The primary outcome was oncologic control, defined as negative followup in-field biopsy of treated cancer. Prostate specific antigen, Sexual Health Inventory for Men, International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite domain scores were assessed 3-monthly till 12 months. Biopsy was performed at 6 or 12 months for high or low/intermediate risk cancer, respectively. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with minimum followup of 12 months were included in the study. The majority of patients (67%) had cancer Grade Group 2 or greater. Fifteen patients (28.8%) underwent complete transurethral prostate resection/holmium laser enucleation of prostate procedure for debulking large prostates to avoid postoperative urinary retention.

This study was designed to validate the prognostic utility of a subclassification for high-risk disease with a prospectively collected data set. METHODS: This study identified 3033 men from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial who had been diagnosed from 1993 to 2001 with clinically localized prostate cancer-either intermediate-risk disease (clinical stage T2b-c, a Gleason score of 7, or a PSA level of 10 to 20 ng/mL) or high-risk disease (clinical stage T3-T4, a Gleason score of 8-10, or a PSA level >20 ng/mL)-that was managed with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.

We investigated institutional variations in PSM after RP, as well as clinical and demographic factors predicting PSM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing RP for clinically localized CaP were identified in the National Cancer Database in 2010 to 2013 and clinicodemographics were recorded. Treating institution was defined as academic (AMC) or nonacademic medical centers (nAMC). The primary outcome was the PSM rate. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity matching with inverse probability treatment weighing were used to both compare outcomes between AMC and nAMC and to identify predictors of PSM following RP. RESULTS: A total of 167,260 patients met our inclusion criteria. PSM rate was significantly lower in patients treated at AMC (13,435, 18.9%) compared with 22,145 (23.0%) in those treated at nAMC (P < 0.01). The difference between PSM rate in AMC and nAMC was more pronounced in lower volume centers while it was not significant in higher volume centers. On multivariable analysis, age, race, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason score, comorbidity profile, insurance type, income, and treatment facility were significantly associated with PSM rate. CONCLUSION: PSM rates appear to be lower at AMC and higher volume facilities, which can potentially reflect institutional differences in surgical quality. In addition, we identified several socioeconomic and demographic factors that contribute to the likelihood of PSM following RP for localized CaP, suggesting potential systematic variation in the quality of surgical care. The cause of this variation warrants further investigation and evaluation.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,60

AIM: The goal of this study was to assess the impact of AI on patient self-esteem, confidence, and sexual relationships. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. The validated Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) questionnaire, as well as questions regarding AI, stress urinary incontinence (SUI), climacturia, International Prostate Symptom Score, and the International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain, were sent to men who had undergone an RP within the past 24 months at a single institution. The data were de-identified and analyzed using descriptive statistics. OUTCOMES: The outcomes of this study include prevalence of AI, SEAR domain scores, patient and partner bother, management strategies employed by the patients, and the presence of concurrent climacturia or SUI. RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of men experienced post-operative AI; of these, 41% were currently experiencing AI, and 12% reported having prior AI that had resolved. Bother of any severity was reported by 87% of men, and perceived partner bother was reported by 64% of men. Forty-one percent of men with current AI avoided sexual activity due to the presence of AI, and 14% of men with prior AI still avoided intercourse. There was no difference in total SEAR score or in the subdomains of self-esteem, sexual relationship, or confidence between men with current AI compared to those with no AI. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: AI leads to patient bother and avoidance of sexual situations. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This is the largest study specifically evaluating AI and the only study assessing its impact on self-esteem, sexual relationships, and self-confidence. Limitations include lack of a validated AI questionnaire, poor survey response rate, being a single-center study, and the potential for recall bias. CONCLUSION: Although AI is a common occurrence post-RP and is associated with patient bother in the majority of men, it does not impact overall self-esteem, confidence, or sexual relationships compared to post-RP men who have not experienced AI.

Epub 2020 Jan 1.,Onol FF,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31894469,"Pelvic lymph node dissection (pLND) is considered the most reliable method for the detection of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer. Current clinical guidelines recommend performing pLND in intermediate- and high-risk patients that are defined using different clinical nomograms and different cut-off values. Although the detection of lymph node metastatic disease can identify patients who could benefit from adjuvant therapies and potentially improve prostate cancer-related survival outcomes, so far there has been no level 1 evidence to support this survival benefit. Available retrospective data that suggest oncological benefits are subject to various forms of bias. Furthermore, pLND is not feasible or may be risky in some patient-related conditions, such as morbid obesity and previous history of intraabdominal surgery including organ transplants. In this review, we discuss the current controversies surrounding pLND during robotic-assisted prostatectomy in prostate cancer, specifically the pitfalls in interpretation of restricted evidence suggesting its oncological benefits, and examine the potential influence of patient- and surgeon-related factors that may determine the decision to perform pLND.",FALSE,N/A,UNKNOWN,68

Epub 2019 Dec 16.,Bazinet A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31837989,"PURPOSE: We analyzed the rate of preserved potency after prostate brachytherapy (PB) with radioactive seeds and the impact of patient comorbidities on post-PB erectile dysfunction (ED). METHODS: We included 627 patients who were assessed for pre- and postimplant potency between 2005 and 2017. Assessment was based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Scale (CTCAEs). Logistic regression models were used to assess clinical predictors of preserved potency after PB defined as having sufficient erections for sexual activity with or without the need of oral pharmacologic assistance. Covariates included age, diabetes (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia (DLP), coronary artery disease (CAD), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume, and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessments (CAPRA) score. Patients on androgen deprivation therapy or using five alpha reductase inhibitors were excluded from analyses. RESULTS: Post-PB potency was assessed at an average of 6 months (n = 627), 1 year (n = 538), 2 years (=440), 4 years (n = 272), and 5 years (n = 124). At 2 and 5 years, post-PB potency was preserved in 87% and 84% of patients, respectively. When adjusting for all available covariates, advanced age, pre-PB potency, and the presence of vascular comorbidities (HTN, DM, and DLP) were all predictors of potency at 2 years after PB (all p < 0.01). When performing a sensitivity analysis for vascular comorbidities, the presence of DM had the strongest impact on ED than either HTN or DLP (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: More than 84% of patients had preserved potency 5 years after PB. Advanced age, pre-PB potency, and vascular comorbidities had a statistically significant impact on potency after PB.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,55

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent prostate brachytherapy with Cesium-131 (<sup>131</sup>Cs) at our institution and had the potential for at least 24 months of follow up were included in this study. Results are reported for the by NCCN risk group (low, low/high-intermediate, and high), as well as by treatment received (monotherapy, combination external beam radiation + PSI, or trimodal therapy with androgen deprivation). The Phoenix definition (absolute nadir plus 2 ng/mL) was used to define biochemical freedom from disease (BFD). RESULTS: Eight hundred and six men have undergone prostate brachytherapy with Cesium-131 at our institution, and 669 men were included in analysis. Median follow up was 60.0 months (range: 0-144 months). According to NCCN risk categories, 29.9% were low-, 55.6% intermediate-, and 14.5% high-risk.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer at a tertiary referral center, clinical-grade targeted tumor sequencing was performed to quantify tumor DNA copy number alterations and alterations in predefined oncogenic signaling pathways. Disease volume was classified as high volume (≥4 bone metastases or visceral metastases) versus low volume. RESULTS: Among 424 patients (88% white), 213 (50%) had high-volume disease and 211 (50%) had low-volume disease, 275 (65%) had <i>de novo</i> metastatic disease, and 149 (35%) had metastatic recurrence of nonmetastatic disease. Rates of castration resistance [adjusted hazard ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.40-2.41] and death (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.71; 95% CI, 2.28-6.02) were higher in high-volume disease. Tumors from high-volume disease had more copy number alterations. The NOTCH, cell cycle, and epigenetic modifier pathways were the highest-ranking pathways enriched in high-volume disease. <i>De novo</i> metastatic disease differed from metastatic recurrences in the prevalence of <i>CDK12</i> alterations but had similar prognosis. Rates of castration resistance differed 1.5-fold to 5-fold according to alterations in <i>AR, SPOP</i> (inverse), and <i>TP53</i>, and the cell cycle, WNT (inverse), and MYC pathways, adjusting for disease volume and other genomic pathways. Overall survival rates differed 2-fold to 4-fold according to <i>AR, SPOP</i> (inverse), WNT (inverse), and cell-cycle alterations. PI3K pathway alterations were not associated with prognosis once adjusted for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified genomic features associated with prognosis in metastatic castration-sensitive disease that may aid in molecular classification and treatment selection.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,73

Epub 2020 Apr 21.,Williams VM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32359937,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to highlight the importance of timely brachytherapy treatment for patients with gynecologic, breast, and prostate malignancies, and provide a framework for brachytherapy clinical practice and management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers. Where concrete data could not be found, peer-reviewed expert opinion is provided. RESULTS: There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy. Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes. If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy. The use of shorter brachytherapy fractionation schedules will help minimize patient exposure and conserve resources. CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some. Reduced patient exposure and resource utilization is important during COVID-19. Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients. Physicians should continue to follow developing institutional, state, and federal guidelines/recommendations as challenges in delivering care during COVID-19 will continue to evolve.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,65

Epub 2019 Nov 2.,Han H,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679137,"PURPOSE: To compare differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in light of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) as the most common surgical technique for prostate cancer. Previous data on perioperative complication rates of RALRP in HIV(+) patients are limited by small sample size. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample database from 2008 to 2014 was used to query prostate cancer patients who underwent RALRP. HIV(+) patients were identified through ICD9 codes 042, 043, 044, V08 and 079.53. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, rate of blood transfusion, in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay and total cost were compared by univariate, multivariate regression and 1:4 propensity score matched analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 270,319 weighted patients undergoing RALRP were identified, among whom 546 (0.20%) patients were diagnosed with HIV. Patients with HIV were younger, less likely to be white and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that HIV(+) patients had significantly increased genitourinary complications (odds ratio [OR]: 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-10.68) and miscellaneous surgical events (OR 3.19; 95% CI 1.26-8.08). There were no differences in potentially life-threatening cardiac, respiratory and vascular events between patients with and without HIV after RALRP. Propensity score matched analysis yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients who underwent RALRP with HIV did not experience higher risk of potentially life-threatening postoperative complications. RALRP could be safely considered as a surgical treatment for HIV(+) patients with prostate cancer.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,60

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a clear oncologic benefit to ADT in the setting of node-positive prostate cancer treated with postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS: We analyzed data for 372 prostate cancer patients treated at San Raffaele Hospital with postoperative radiotherapy for node-positive disease after radical prostatectomy, 272 received both ADT and radiotherapy. Eighty-six men were followed without an event for more than 10 years. RESULTS: Patients who received postoperative radiotherapy + ADT had more aggressive disease, with higher preoperative PSA level, higher rate of ISUP grade 5, pT3b-T4 tumors and ≥3 positive nodes. At multivariable Cox regression, the comparison between men treated by postoperative radiotherapy + ADT vs. radiotherapy alone did not show a significant difference for overall (hazards ratio: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.45, 1.84; P = 0.8) and cancer-specific survival (hazards ratio: 5.39; 95% confidence intervalI: 0.70, 41.39; P = 0.11). These results remained consistent in a number of sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matching. Consideration of 95% CIs suggests that a clinically significant benefit of ADT in node-positive patients receiving radiotherapy after surgery is unlikely. CONCLUSIONS: We can exclude the sort of large survival benefit that would be required to justify the risks and toxicities of ADT in men with node-positive disease receiving postoperative radiotherapy. Awaiting larger and more powered studies on this topic, men with pN+ prostate cancer treated with postoperative radiotherapy should not receive ADT outside well-controlled clinical trials.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,TRUE,71

METHODS: 425 men were treated with external beam radiotherapy (59.4 Gy, 33 fractions) and <sup>125</sup>J seed-brachytherapy (S-BT, 100 Gy). Biochemical recurrence (BR) was defined either as radio-oncologic (rBR), using a +2 ng/mL prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase above a nadir value, or as surgical (sBR), using a 2-year posttreatment PSA of ≥0.2 ng/mL. Biochemical recurrence-free, metastasis-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival were calculated at 5 and 10 years using the Kaplan-Meier method. Standard validation tests were used to compare both thresholds. RESULTS: After a median of 7 years, overall recurrence rates were 10.4% and 31.5% for rBR and sBR definitions, respectively. Both failure definitions proved sensitive for the prediction of metastases and cancer-specific death, whereas the rBR definition was significantly more specific. The accuracies of a correct prediction of metastases and death of prostate cancer were 73.1% vs. 96.2% and 72.2% vs. 92.9% for sBR vs. rBR, respectively. The inferior validity results of the sBR definition were attributable to a PSA-bounce phenomenon occurring in 56% of patients with sBR. Still, using the less suitable sBR definition, the results of CRT compared favorably to BRFS rates of surgical interventions. CONCLUSION: After CRT, the radio-oncological (aka Phoenix) failure definition is more reliable than a fixed surgical endpoint. Exclusively in high-risk patients, sBR offers a direct comparison across surgical and nonsurgical treatment options at 5 and 10 years.",TRUE,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,86
